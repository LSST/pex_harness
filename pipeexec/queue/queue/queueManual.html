<h1>lsst.apps.mw.dps.pipeexec.queue Manual</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The lsst.apps.mw.dps.pipeexec.queue routines are used in conjunction with each other to move files
into a directory and retrieve files in the order they were place there.  There
are two methods:

<ul>
<li>put - moves a file into a new directory</li>
<p>
 
    This method takes two arguments: the name of the file you want to move,
    and the directory where the file will be moved.


<li>get - gets the oldest file in this directory.  If there are no files in this
      directory, block until a file appears.</li>
<p>

    This method takes one argument:  the directory you want to watch.  It
    returns with a filename.
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<h2>Example Usage</h2>
<p>
Two example programs in pymw/examples/queue/, queueget.py and queueput.py, show how methods in 
queue.py work.   The following is an example of how they're used.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Open two shell windows.</li>
<p>
<li>In the first window, create two directories:</li>
<p>
	$ mkdir tempdir tempdir2

<li>In the first window, execute the queueget.py program:</li>
<p>
	$ python queueget.py tempdir2
<p>
<li>In the second window, put a file into the tempdir directory</li>
<p>
	$ echo  >tempdir/file1
<p>
<li>In the second window, execute the queueput.py program:</li>
<p>
	$ python queueput.py tempdir/file1 tempdir2
</ol>

You should see the message:

<pre>
        got tempdir2/file1
</pre>

in the first window.
