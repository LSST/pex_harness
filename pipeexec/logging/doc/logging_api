The API for logging DC1 data is a simple Python function, log. The log
messages are written to a central logfile on a specified node using 
TCP sockets.

>>>import lsst.mw.dps.pipeexec.logging as log
>>>log.log (message, priority, source)

Priority is defined in any man page for syslog (either in C or Python).
However, the Python Library logging facility only knows about a subset
of the priorities defined for syslog.  So, the LSST logger only allows
that subset.

Priority levels include:

    CRITICAL	critical conditions
    ERROR		error conditions
    WARNING		warning conditions
    INFO		informational message
    DEBUG		debugging message

Message is also a Python string, as is source.  Source is an optional
parameter that provides applications a tag to use for log sorting. Potential
uses for this field are source filename or location in the code that
originated the message.  An empty string here is fine.

>>> log.log("test of python logging", log.DEBUG, "python interpreter")
