/**
\mainpage lsst::pex::harness;  the LSST Pipeline Harness

\section secIntro Introduction

The LSST Pipeline Harness is a package for constructing pipelines out of reusable scientific 
processing modules and executing pipelines within an parallel processing environment. 
The harness serves to separate middleware functionality---management of parallel processing, 
I/O functionality, access to persistence, aggregation and connection of processing stages, etc. 
The Pipeline class encapsulates the main executing pipeline; it spawns a number of 
parallel workers denoted Slices that can be distributed across multiple nodes. 
Both Pipeline and Slice workers execute a loop of application stages that have been 
provided with pipeline policy.  
The software container that the harness provides for hosting an algorithm written 
by an application developer is the Stage class.  The Stage class provides a standard API
for integrating code into the LSST Pipeline Harnesss framework.
