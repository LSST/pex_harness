Version 1 LSST Logging
----------------------
While using logTest.py, I found some odd results in the logfile generated.
There are multiple entries of the same message.  The multiple is not
predictable.  Perhaps with a delayed ACK, the underlying socket send from the
threaded socket server (SocketServer.ThreadingTCPServer) is resending its
packet.  Below is a tail of the logfile for the logTest.py version committed.

2006-08-06 18:12:15,793 ds30.ncsa.uiuc.edu DEBUG    LogTest: Test1 of LSST logging
2006-08-06 18:12:15,798 ds30.ncsa.uiuc.edu INFO     : Test2 of LSST logging
2006-08-06 18:12:15,798 ds30.ncsa.uiuc.edu INFO     : Test2 of LSST logging

Note that the problem gets worse if we enable the 1-10 log messages.  It seems
to be a risk that we will swamp the socket buffers easily if my guess is
correct.
