# This policy file executes the Pipeline within a scenario where it peforms 
# a simple test of IOStage.InputStage
# It initially blocks to receive an event of topic triggerIpdpEvent, which we 
# take to be a simple event carrying a "visitId" which is a string. 
# The value received in the event is then used by point to an appropriate data file
# In this example the data is retrieved as   PythonType: "lsst.daf.base.DataProperty"
# with  Storage: "BoostStorage", as opposed to actual FitsStorage. 
# 
# The required event is issued with the script triggerIpdpEventTransmit.py
