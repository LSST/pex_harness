# pipeline_policy_MOPS.json
#
# This policy file executes the Pipeline within a scenarion where it waits
# for two events, one prior to the first Stage, and another after the second Stage
# The first even is a "mops1Event" that holds (FOVRA/Dec, FOVID, FOVTime) and
# the second simulates the Trigger that the Association pipeline needs from
# the Image Processing and Detection Pipeline
# These events are issues with test scripts
# Mops1EventTransmit.py and AssocIPDPTriggerEventTransmit.py, respectively.
