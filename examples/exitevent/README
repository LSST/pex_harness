Running the example:
--------------------

To place the example stages into the working PYTHONPATH :

% export PYTHONPATH ${PWD}/../stages:${PYTHONPATH}    (bash)

or

% setenv PYTHONPATH ${PWD}/../stages:${PYTHONPATH}     (tcsh)

One executes the pipeline then with:

% launchPipeline.py exitevent_policy.paf <some-run-id>

such as

% launchPipeline.py exitevent_policy.paf test_2390

Description
-----------

The exitevent example demonstrates how to configure a Pipeline to issue an event 
upon exiting. The event is issued at the middleware level, within shutdown, as
opposed to a particular Stage. 

In the pipeline policy file, in this example exitevent_policy.paf, we place 

exitTopic: "SampleExitTopic"

This will result in an event of this topic being issued. If the exitTopic 
entry in the policy file is absent, then no exit event is issued. 

By default this example will run with the Pipeline with one Slice on a single node.
Edit the MPI machinefile "nodelist.scr" to specify the hostname of the current host.

One can test the exit event functionality by, in one shell running the provided 
listenEvent.py script, which will block for the arrival of an event of topic "SampleExitTopic".

% python listenEvent.py 

In a separate shell the pipeline may be executed via, for example, 

% launchPipeline.py exitevent_policy.paf test_2390

The listenEvent.py should receive the event, unblock and terminate.
