Running an example interSlice communication pipeline: examples/syncSlices
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is found under pex_harness/examples/syncSlices . 
Change to this directory to find files

% ls
nodelist.scr  syncslices.paf  run.sh   README 

The run.sh is a very simple launching script to test a Pipeline. 
(A more configurable mechanism for setup and launching of pipelines 
is developed within the dc2pipe/dc3pipe packages and the full 
orchestration layer.) At the top of the run.sh one finds input 
parameters that one can edit

nodes=1
nslices=16

These default parameters of a single node and sixteen slices 
are sufficient to illustrate the example.

The MPI "machine file" is called nodelist.scr and contains the entry

lsst8.ncsa.uiuc.edu:17

The parameter value 17 that appears after the hostname specifies the total 
number of MPI processes on the host, and so equals the sum of the 1 Pipeline 
process and the 16 Slices.

The pipeline can be launched by placing the policy file and a runid 
on the command line:

 ./run.sh syncslices.paf test_20001
