Running the example:
--------------------

To place the example stages into the working PYTHONPATH :

% export PYTHONPATH ${PWD}/../stages:${PYTHONPATH}    (bash)

or

% setenv PYTHONPATH ${PWD}/../stages:${PYTHONPATH}     (tcsh)

One executes the pipeline then with:

% launchPipeline.py association_policy.paf  <some-run-id>

such as

% launchPipeline.py association_policy.paf test_2390

Description
-----------

The association example is a mockup of the Association Pipeline that demonstrates the 
trigger event dependence of the full version.  The mock association pipeline has 
4 application stages:    
        LoadStage 
        MatchDiaSourceStage 
        MatchMopStage 
        StoreStage

The intial LoadStage has a trigger event dependence, and so the Pipeline execution 
blocks for the arrival of an event of the appropriate topic, which is denoted
"triggerAssociationEvent" in this example. Later in the pipeline execution, information 
is needed from the moving objects pipeline, and so prior to the third stage MatchMopStage
the Pipeline again blocks for the arrival of an event, of topic "triggerMatchMopEvent"
this time.

By default the mock example will run with the Pipeline and one Slice on a single node.

To execute this scenario, in one shell execute, for example

% launchPipeline.py association_policy.paf test_2390

and in a separate shell provide the trigger events

% python triggerAssociationEventTransmitter.py  

% python triggerMatchMopEventTransmitter.py

The Pipeline will cycle around repeated through the four stages 
until a shutdown event is issued 

% python triggerShutdownEventTransmitter.py

if an ActiveMQbroker other than the LSST default (lsst8.ncsa.uiuc.edu) 
is used, this needs to be specified in the pipeline policy file (under 
"eventBrokerHost") and the trigger event python scripts.
